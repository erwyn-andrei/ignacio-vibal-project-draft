# CampusCalc
"Your GPA and University friend, from start to end!"

**CampusCalc** is a website that focuses on pairing/matching prospective university students to see if they are compatible with some of the best universities in the world. There are three main portions of our website: calculation, university matching, and a university description portion.

The first page includes an about us that explains the website with a description of every feature of the website.

JavaScript comes into play with the first feature, the calculation. The calculation portion involves several features. Firstly, the **General Weighted Average (GWA) / Grade Point Average (GPA) / Numerical Grade calculator** provides you your expected final grade based on the grade you got for said subject and the units involved with it. It will have 3 different calculations involving 3 different inputs. 

**Option 1**
Input: GWA; Output: GWA/GPA

**Option 2**
Input: GPA; Output: GWA/GPA

**Option 3**
Input: Numerical Grade; Output: Numerical/GWA/GPA

Using JavaScript it will use the following formula to calculate for the grade:

**Grade(Numeric/GWA/GPA) x Weight(Units) = Final Grade For That Subject**

Then to get the overall grade the calculator uses:

**Sum of Final Grades for each Subject รท Total Units = Final Grade**

Additionally, there will be an option for custom subjects with custom units. You will be able to create your own subjects with provided units for your own convenience.

Next, the matching portion contains a part where you can input your GWA/GPA/Numerical Grade and if applicable, your SAT/ACT score. Then, it will show all of the universities on our website then show if your scores/grades are average for students who get accepted into those universities. It will display universities and list them down based on how likely you are to get into them.

Lastly, the university descriptions portion shows a list of the 60 universities on our site with 10 of the best universities in each continent excluding Antarctica being on the list.

The first page will have the list of continents then when you click a continent, you will be redirected to a page with the university for that continent. For example: if you click Asia, then you will be redirected to the page with the top ten Asian universities.

Each university will have one picture on this website where if you click it, you will be redirected to a page that will contain information about the university including location, cost, what fields the university is known for, campus life/academic programs, statistics of accepted students etc.
